Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **Date pickers on Booking page** replaced with a styled `react-datepicker` component that matches the site's brand:
  - Inputs now show a branded orange calendar icon and clear placeholder text, making them obviously clickable
  - Calendar popup has an orange header, orange selected-day highlight, and light-orange hover states — consistent with the rest of the UI
  - End date automatically prevents selecting a date before or equal to the start date
  - Changing the start date clears the end date if it would become invalid
  - Dates display in human-readable `dd MMM yyyy` format (e.g. `26 Mar 2026`) instead of the raw browser default
- Added `react-datepicker` dependency (`frontend/package.json`)
- Added brand-colour CSS overrides for `react-datepicker` in `index.css`

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Inline review form on Truck Detail page** — customers with a completed, unreviewed booking for a truck now see a "Write a Review" form directly in the reviews section, without having to go to the Customer Dashboard
- `GET /api/bookings/eligible-review/{truck_id}` — new backend endpoint that checks if the authenticated customer has a completed, unreviewed booking for a given truck; returns `{"booking_id": int|null}`
- New translation keys: `truckDetail.writeReview`, `truckDetail.reviewDone`, `truckDetail.reviewNote` (EN + RO)

### Fixed
- **SQLite threading crash** (`ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread`) — added `check_same_thread=False` to `sqlite3.connect()` in `database.py`; root cause was FastAPI's thread pool executing sync route functions in different threads than the one that opened the connection
- **Error messages not displaying** — FastAPI raises `HTTPException` with a `detail` field, but the frontend was reading `data.error` (always `undefined`), causing all backend error messages to silently fall back to generic text. Fixed in all 7 error handlers across:
  - `Login.jsx`, `Register.jsx`
  - `BookingPage.jsx`, `AddEditTruck.jsx`
  - `OwnerDashboard.jsx` (delete truck, update booking status)
  - `CustomerDashboard.jsx` (cancel booking, submit review)
- **"Make" label** renamed to **"Brand"** in English (`addTruck.make` translation key)

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-26

### Changed — Backend rewritten from Node.js/Express to Python/FastAPI

**Why this migration was made:**

- **Ecosystem & readability** — Python's syntax is more readable for data-heavy server logic. SQLite queries, data validation, and business rules all become cleaner with Python's native types and Pydantic models.
- **Built-in type validation** — FastAPI uses Pydantic models, so every request body is automatically validated and documented with no extra code. In the Express version, all validation was done manually with `if (!field)` checks.
- **Auto-generated API docs** — FastAPI automatically generates interactive Swagger UI at `/docs` and a ReDoc page at `/redoc`. This makes testing and exploring the API significantly easier.
- **Dependency injection** — FastAPI's `Depends()` system cleanly handles authentication, database connections, and role checks per-route, replacing Express middleware chains.
- **Same database, zero data migration** — Python's built-in `sqlite3` module reads the exact same `truck_app.db` file. No schema changes, no data loss.
- **No native build issues** — The original backend was switched from `better-sqlite3` to `node:sqlite` to avoid native compilation. Python's `sqlite3` is a pure built-in with no build step at all.
- **Python is the dominant language in backend and data work** — Aligning the backend with Python improves long-term maintainability and opens the door for future data features (analytics, ML recommendations, etc.).

### Added
- `backend/main.py` — FastAPI application entry point (replaces `server.js`)
- `backend/database.py` — SQLite connection factory using built-in `sqlite3` with `row_factory` for dict-like rows (replaces `db.js`)
- `backend/auth.py` — JWT creation and `Depends()`-based auth guards using `python-jose` and `fastapi.security.HTTPBearer` (replaces `middleware/auth.js`)
- `backend/routers/auth.py` — Register, login, and `/me` routes with `passlib` bcrypt hashing (replaces `routes/auth.js`)
- `backend/routers/trucks.py` — Full truck CRUD with dynamic query building and owner stats route (replaces `routes/trucks.js`)
- `backend/routers/bookings.py` — Booking creation with conflict detection, customer/owner views, status update (replaces `routes/bookings.js`)
- `backend/routers/reviews.py` — Truck reviews, create and delete with ownership validation (replaces `routes/reviews.js`)
- `backend/requirements.txt` — Python dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `python-jose[cryptography]`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `python-multipart`

### Changed
- `start-app.bat` — Backend launch command changed from `node server.js` to `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 5000`; also now shows the auto-docs URL (`http://localhost:5000/docs`)

### Kept (unchanged)
- All frontend React code — zero changes required; the API contract is identical
- `backend/truck_app.db` — same SQLite database file, fully compatible
- All route paths and HTTP methods remain the same

### Node.js backend files retained
The original `server.js`, `db.js`, `middleware/`, and `routes/` JS files are kept in the repository for reference but are no longer used. The new entry point is `main.py`.
